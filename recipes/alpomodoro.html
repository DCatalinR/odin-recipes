    <p>Ingredients per 1 person</p>

    <ul>
        <li>100 grams of Spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese for garnish(optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for about 1 minute, 
            then transfer them to an ice bath. Peel off the skin and chop
             the tomatoes.</li>>
        <li>n a pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
            Add minced garlic and sauté until it becomes fragrant 
            but not browned.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Season with salt and 
            black pepper. Cook for about 15-20 minutes, crushing the 
            tomatoes with a spoon as they soften.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta in a pot of
             salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve a cup
              of pasta water before draining.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked pasta to the pan with the tomato sauce.
             Toss to coat the pasta evenly, allowing it to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add torn basil leaves to the pasta and sauce.
             Stir gently to incorporate the basil.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
             If the sauce is too thick, add some 
            reserved pasta water gradually until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Plate the Pasta al Pomodoro, garnish with additional basil leaves,
             and, if desired, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
