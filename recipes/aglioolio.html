         <p>Ingredients per 1 person</p>
         <ul>
            <li>100 grams of Spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>Red pepper flackes to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan cheese for garnish(optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water
                 until al dente.
                 Reserve a cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
                 <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
                     Add thinly sliced garlic and red pepper flakes.
                     Sauté until the garlic turns golden but not browned.</li>
                 <li>Allow the garlic and red pepper flakes to infuse
                     into the olive oil over low heat for a few minutes.
                     This creates a flavorful base for the sauce.</li>
                 <li>Add the cooked and drained pasta to the pan with the
                     garlic-infused oil.
                     Toss the pasta to coat evenly in the flavorful oil.</li>
                 <li>Season with salt to taste. If the pasta seems dry,
                     add some of the reserved
                     pasta water gradually until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
                 <li>Sprinkle chopped fresh parsley over the pasta.
                     This adds a burst of freshness to the dish.</li>
                 <li>Plate the Pasta Aglio e Olio, and if desired, garnish
                     with grated Parmesan cheese.
                </li>
        </ol>
